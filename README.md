# URL to Title

Have you ever wanted a cleaner, more organized browser? The **URL to Title** Chrome extension replaces or supplements the page title with its URL, giving you a quick reference at a glance.

## How It Works

This lightweight extension is designed to be simple and effective. It offers two distinct modes that you can easily toggle:

1.  **Replace Title with URL**: This option completely removes the original page title and replaces it with the full URL. It's a great choice for those who prefer minimalism and want the most direct information possible in their browser tabs.
2.  **Append URL to Title**: If you still want to keep the original page title, this option is for you. It adds the full URL to the end of the existing title, providing both the site's intended name and its address.
